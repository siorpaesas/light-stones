## **The Light Stones – Part 1**

My train had already stopped when I got up from my seat and began to take step by step towads the exit door. Only a few people were leaving the train along with me. It was still very early in the morning and I came here to watch a certain phenomenon that would only occur once in a year. During my walk up to the church tower, the antique buildings were softly being touched by the first sun light of the day. The colours and the light almost looked like they were guided by an artist who made a beautiful painting out of the scenery from somewhere far up in the skies. He appeared to be using the sun as a brush.At the end of the small street, I spotted the old stone house which was described to me the day before. At this very day of the year, the sun would be in the perfect angle to produce an amazing and spectacular light show inside of that stone house. It is told that an antique circle of alchemists was using this biulding to run some secret experiments with light and water. Old scribbles were telling tales about strange occurences like small rainbows on sunny days or the whole building lighting up in a gigantic green ray of light.I knocked on the door. Everything around me was completely calm. I could not even hear birds singing or the faint sound of a road. It almost felt like I had catched a train that would not only take me to this town but also back in time.The door was opened by an old man who let me in. In the background of him, I could see the stones. They were shining. Only very slightly, but visibly. The man nodded towards me and said: „You’re the first one appearing this early in the morning. Have you read the old scribbles all to the end?“ His voice had something epic on it and caused my body to quiver. Yet I was feeling very comfortable and excited about what could be happening soon in this house.I replied: „Every single one! I could not believe what I was reading and thought of them as old wives‘ tells. But still, they would not let me sleep anymore. I had to take a look into it by myself.“„Many young people like you do come here to see with their own eyes.“, the old man continued, „yet, they cannot sense the old energy source that is wrapping this place.“.Me: „The scribbles say, it’s not just the sun that contains the energy to cause these strange light phenomenons. There must be some sort of other energy catalyst protecting or defending this place.“The man turned his back to me and slowly walked towards a door that looked like it was built by some drunk dwarfes of one of those medieval age strategy games. He grabbed a large key out of his pocket and opened the door: „Let me show you something.“ He offered me to follow him.„Will you lock me into an old dungeon leaving me with nothing but a small piece of bread and no water?“„You must come with me and see for yourself if you want to understand the meaning of the scribbles.“Once again, his epic sounding words shattered all of my natural resistance against dark and narrow places. The old man was taking the lead. There was a long and narrow stairway leading down to some sort of cellar. This place was only missing the torchs that would be spending the light. Instead, the barely visible shining of the stones was emitting just enough light to prevent both of us from stumbling down.„This cellar appears to be only lit by these stones.“, I stated.The man had already taken the last step of the stairway. He opened another door. I was following him and was now standing in a dark room that was completely covered with these stones. The cellar was as high as the building itself and with every step I took, I noticed that it was not a cellar at all. It was more like a pitfall with just one exit and beautiful light. The stones were shining brighter and brighter with every row I was looking up high. It was just gorgeous! The light of the stones seemed to be colourless. I could not say what color of light the stones were emitting.Suddenly, the growling of some huge stone plates on the ground made a few heavy bursts of adrenaline rush up and down my body. The old man said: „You can see the energy far up from where you are living. But can you see the energy from far down from where you are living as well?“Another small stairway had opened in the floor. It seemed to be leading down in circles. The old man spoke to me: „From now on, you will be on your own. Do be careful with your steps.“„How did you manage to keep something so marvellous behind the shadows of secret?“, I wanted to know.The old man came up to me, laid his left hand on my shoulder and whispered: „Only very few people are privy to the knowledge of the scribbles. You’re one of these people now allthough I am not sure what exactly you are aware of.“ He took a deep breath and stared right into my eyes. His voice changed from epic to cautionary: „You remember the warnings you have seen in the scribbles? Keep them in your mind well! You might face danger down there. You might even need to darken your sight!“ He pointed to his eyes before he turned himself away from me. The old man slowly walked out of the pitfall looking room. I was now alone with the shinig of the stones and their unspeakable beauty.I tried to remember the warnings that I read in the scribbles. There indeed were warnings in there! But there was nothing that was referring to the term ‚darken your sight‘.I could no longer hold back my excitement about the lights that the scribbles spoke of. So I started to walk along the stairs that were in the ground. But still, I could not entirely forget about the mentionned dangers that could lure down there. With every step, I got deeper into the ground. The stones were still faintly illuminating my path.I had lost count of how many stair stones I had left behind when suddenly a huge cathedral-like and cylindric hall opened on the left side of the path. I was at the top most edge of the hall and I was able to see the circling of the stairway that led all the way down to the floor along the wall of the light stones. The stones became brighter and brighter as my eyes reached the bottom of the hall. Deep down, they looked even brighter as the sun! „Damn, I will need sunglasses if I want to go down there!“, I said to myself. But who in the world would bring sunglasses on a trip that leads under ground? That would be similar to some italian mafioso who would join a gun shooting with a knife.Although I forgot to bring something that would ‚darken my sight‘, I continued walking down the stairs while watching the amazing light show of the stones. I could see bursts of light warping around and changing the light intensity from dark to glistening. It looked like water that was illuminated and moving very slowly. For the first time, I could clearly see a colour! From deep down, green bursts were darting their tongues upwards. It first looked like fire. As the bursts made it up to the ceiling of the hall, I realized that it were the stones that took on the green colour. It was so gorgeous to look at.The light show went on and I kept stepping down to what I expected to be the center of the light source. I was still far away from the ground of the hall as I started to hear a crackle. It sounded like some power flow that was breaking repeatedly. Memories of a presentation in a power plant during my school time came into present.A strange noise coming from the floor of the hall cracked all my memories of the past. A heavy gust out of wind and light hit my face and made me almost go blind. As soon as my startling had faded, I tried to open my eyes again. I asked myself what had happened. The light was still there but something was different. The green bursts were now quicker and kept reaching the ceiling all the time. „Ha, let’s get the spectacle to the next level!“. The echoes of my words spoken out of excitement had just died away when some soap bubble looking things came hovering up from the hall floor. I could see them wander back and fourth. As the first bubble reached one of the stones next to me, I started to get scared. The blubble was consumed by the stone and the fusion of the two of them created a fire out of white light. I could sense the heat of the fire on my hands although I was about 6 metres away.„Now would be a good time to leave this place!“, I thought and started to climb up the stairway. After a few steps another heavy gust hit my body. This time it knocked me down and the light didn’t go away anymore. It was to bright for me to keep my eyes opened. I buried my face in my hands and crouched down. All the stones around me lit up like sun flares. I tried to open my eyes over and over again but it was painfully bight. Now, panic started to take over my body. I tried to save myself all way up to the top. I tried stumbling a few steps up but I knew it would be hopeless. I was to far away from the hall’s entrance. It appeared I had to pay a very high price for watching this tremendous light show. I was still crouching on the stairs and my desperate tries to keep my eyes closed started to hurt my eye lids. It felt like cramps but I had to hold it as long as possible. I searched my backpack for something that would help me cover my face and protect me from the glistening light. I couldn’t find a thing. After a few seconds I buried my head in the backpack and the pain finally started to wear off. I managed to control my panic reactions after a few moments and hoped for my brain to gain back the control over my body. From time to time, I checked whether it was allright to open my eyes, but the glistening of the light would not wear off.I was lieing on the stairs with my head stuck into my backpack to protect my eyes from the laser pointing light show caused by the stones. „Damn, if this horrible glowing of those stones is coupled with the sun light, I’m going to stay here for the rest of the day!“, I shouted out loud! And this was possibly just fibbed! If these fires were going to catch me, I could even be ending up as a roasted early bird! No more reading scribbles and meeting old men with epic voices! What a shame that would be!
