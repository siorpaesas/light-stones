## Epic Man's Advice

My train had already stopped when I got up from my seat and began to take step by step towads the exit door. Only a few people were leaving the train along with me. It was very early in the morning and I came here to watch a certain phenomenon that would only occur once a year. During my walk up to the church tower, the antique buildings were softly being touched by the first sun light of the day. The colours and the lights almost looked like they were guided by an artist who made a beautiful painting out of the scenery from somewhere far up in the sky. He used the sun as his brush.  
At the end of the small street, I spotted the old stone house which was described to me by some crazy fellow with curly hair the day before. At this very day of the year, the sun would stand in the perfect angle to produce an amazing light show inside of that stone house. It is told that an antique circle of alchemists was using this building to run some secret experiments with light and water. Old scribbles were telling tales about strange occurences like small rainbows on sunny days or the whole building lighten up in a gigantic green flare.  
I knocked on the door. Everything around me was completely calm. I could not even hear birds singing or the faint sound of a road nearby. It almost felt like I had caught a train that would not only take me to this town but also back in time.  
The door was opened by an old man. In the background of him, I could see the stones. They were shining. Only very slightly, but visibly.  
The man nodded towards me and said: „You’re the first one appearing this early in the morning. Have you read the old scribbles all to the end?“ His voice had something epic on it and caused my body to quiver. Yet I was feeling very comfortable and excited about what could be happening soon inside this house.  
I replied: „Every single one! I could not believe what I was reading and thought of those stories as old wives‘ tells. But still, they would not let me sleep anymore. I had to take a look into it by myself.“  
„Many young people like you do come here to see with their own eyes.“, the old man continued, „yet, they cannot sense the old energy source that is wrapping this place.“.  
e: „The scribbles say, it’s not just the sun that contains the energy to cause these strange light phenomenons. There must be some sort of other energy catalyst protecting this place.“  
The man turned his back to me and slowly walked towards a door that looked like it was built by some drunk dwarfes of one of those medieval age strategy games. He grabbed a large key out of his pocket and opened the door: „Let me show you something.“ He signed me to follow him.  
„Will you lock me into an old dungeon leaving me with nothing but a small piece of bread and a can of water?“  
„You must come with me and see for yourself if you want to understand the meaning of the scribbles.“  
Once again, his epic sounding words shattered all of my natural resistance against dark and narrow places. The old man was taking the lead. There was a long and narrow stairway leading down to some sort of cellar. This place was only missing the torches that would be spending the light. Instead, the barely visible shining of the stones was emitting just enough light to prevent both of us from stumbling down.  
„This cellar appears to be only lit by those stones.“, I stated.  
The man had already taken the last step of the stairway. He opened another door. I was following him and was now standing in a dark room that was completely covered with those stones. The cellar was as high as the building itself and with every step I took, I noticed that it was not a cellar at all. It was more like a pitfall with just one exit and beautiful lights. The stones were shining brighter and brighter with every row I was looking up high. It was just gorgeous! The light of the stones seemed to be colourless. I could not say what colour of light the stones were emitting.  
Suddenly, the growling of some huge stone plates on the ground made a few heavy bursts of adrenaline rush up and down my body. The old man said: „You can see the energy from far up where you are living. But can you see the energy from far down where you are living as well?“  
Another small stairway had opened in the floor. It seemed to be leading down in circles. The old man spoke to me: „From now on, you will be on your own. Do be careful with your steps.“  
„How did you manage to keep something so marvellous behind the shadows of secret?“, I wanted to know.  
The old man came up to me, laid his left hand on my shoulder and whispered: „Only very few people are privy to the knowledge of the scribbles. You’re one of those now allthough I am sensing quite a bit of insecurity inside you. You seen scared of what you will be encountering on this day of your great adventure.“ He took a deep breath and stared right into my eyes. His voice changed from epic to cautionary: „You remember the warnings you have seen in the scribbles? Keep them in your mind well! You might face danger down there. You might even need to darken your sight!“ He pointed to my eyes before he turned himself away from me. The old man slowly walked out of the pitfall shaped room. I was now alone with the shining of the stones and their unspeakable beauty.  
I tried to remember the warnings that I read in the scribbles. There indeed were warnings in there! But there was nothing that was referring to the term ‚darken your sight‘. In every adventure of a fantasy novel, scribbles like those always refer to some ancient riddle that must be conquered by the hero. But I was no hero at all. I just wanted to see whats behind of all this.  
The curly haired fellow I met the day before, was talking about some sort of energy source. An energy source that can only be seen using a certain device. Those energy sources would throw out measurable quantities of power grains from time to time. No one could tell how this happens exactly and no one knows about when this happens. He warned me about long term impacts of this energy sources. They would cover your consience in some cases and even have impact on your brain and thoughts.  
All his chit-chat sounded way to strange to me. I did not believe him a single word. But still, I could not get some of his blabbering out of my head anymore. It seemed to follow me ever since.  
I could no longer hold back my excitement about the lights that the scribbles spoke of. So I started to walk along the stairs that had appeared on the ground. I threw all the blabbering by the curly haired fellow over board. But still, I could not entirely forget about the dangers that he and the scribbles were speaking of. With every step, I got deeper into the ground. The stones were still faintly illuminating my path.  
I had lost count of how many stair stones I had left behind when suddenly a huge cathedral-looking hall opened on the left side of the path. I was at the top most edge of the hall and I was able to see the circling of the stairway that led all the way down to the floor along the wall of the light stones. The stones became brighter and brighter as my eyes reached the bottom of the hall. Deep down, they looked even brighter as the sun! „Damn, I will need sunglasses if I want to go down there!“, I said to myself. But who in the world would bring sunglasses on a trip that leads under ground? That would be similar to some mafioso who would join a shooting with a knife.  
Although I forgot to bring something that would ‚darken my sight‘, I continued walking down the stairs while watching the amazing light show of the stones. I could see bursts of light warping around and changing the light intensity from dark to glistening. It looked like water that was illuminated and moving very slowly. For the first time, I could clearly see a colour! From deep down, green bursts were darting their tongues upwards. It first looked like fire. As the bursts made it up to the ceiling of the hall, I realized that it was the stones that took on the green colour. It was so gorgeous to look at.  
The light show went on and I kept stepping down hoping to reach what I expected to be the center of the light source. I was still far away from the ground of the hall as I started to hear a crackle. It sounded like some power flow that was breaking repeatedly. Memoirs of a presentation in a power plant during my school time came into present.  
A strange noise coming from the floor of the hall cracked all my memoirs of the past. A heavy gust out of wind and light hit my face and made me almost go blind. As soon as my startling had faded, I tried to open my eyes again. I was wondering what just had happened. The light was still there but something had changed. The green bursts were now quicker and kept reaching the ceiling all the time. „Ha, let’s get the spectacle to the next level!“. The echoes of my words spoken out of excitement had just died away when some soap bubble looking things came hovering up from the hall floor. I could see them wander back and forth. As the first bubble reached one of the stones next to me, I started to get scared. The blubble was consumed by the stone and the fusion of the two of them created a fire out of white light. I could sense the heat of the fire on my hands although I was about six metres away.  
„Now would be a good time to leave this place!“, I thought and started climbing up the stairway. After a few steps another heavy gust hit my body. This time it knocked me down and the light didn’t go away anymore. It was to bright for me to keep my eyes open. I buried my face in my hands and crouched down. All the stones around me lit up like sun flares. I tried to open my eyes over and over again but it was painfully bight. Now, panic started to take over my body. I tried to save myself all the way up to the top. I tried stumbling up a few steps but I knew it would be hopeless. I was already to far away from the hall’s entrance. It appeared I had to pay a very high price for watching this tremendous light show.  
I was still crouching on the stairs and my desperate tries to keep my eyes closed started to hurt my eye lids. It felt like cramps but I had to hold it no matter what. I searched my backpack for something that would help me cover my face and would protect my eyes from the glistening light. I couldn’t find anything. After a few seconds I buried my head in the backpack and the pain finally started to wear off. I managed to control my panic reactions after a few moments and hoped for my brain to gain back the control over my body. From time to time, I checked whether it was allright to open my eyes, but the glistening of the stones would not wear off.  
I was still laying on the stairs with my head stuck into my backpack to protect my eyes from the laser pointing light show. „Damn, if this horrible glowing is coupled with the sun, I’m going to stay here for the rest of the day!“, I shouted out loud! And this was possibly just fibbed! If these fires were going to catch me, I could even be ending up as a roasted early bird! No more reading scribbles and meeting old men with epic voices! What a shame that would be! No more preventing myself from bursting out of laughter caused by crazy looking curly haired energy grain snuff consuming fools.
